This code wraps Espeak and Festival, so go install those before trying
this out.

You can instance the Festival or Espeak classes to see what voices are
available on the system for that speech engine.

To create a "say" function, use the voice_builder function; use the
default args if you don't care what it sounds like.  The result is a
function which you can pass text to.

The "ramble" function takes a "say" function, and dumps random
dictionary words into it.

"timed_ramble" is the same thing but with a delay.

"reader" takes a path and reads the contents of the file aloud.
