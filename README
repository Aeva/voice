This is a text-to-speech module for python which wraps Festival and
Espeak on GNU/Linux systems (and possibly other Unixes).  Only one of
the two libraries needs to be installed for this module to work.

When installed, this module provides the following commands:

 - say
 - readtome

The "say" command will pass either its command line arguments or
whatever was pipe into it, and in turn pass that to the text-to-speech
backend.  This currently does give the option to pick the voice or the
engine, however a future version will.

The "readtome" command is used for downloading a webpage and passing
it along to the text-to-speech backend.  See the --help text for
information on exact usage.  This command lets you select either an
xpath query, an element id, or (if either are omitted) reading the
from the document body.  It also lets you configure the engine and
voice if you so desire to do so.


This module relies on the following 3rd party python libraries:

 - lxml
 - requests
